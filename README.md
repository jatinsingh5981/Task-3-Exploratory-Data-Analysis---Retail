# Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail dataset. The goal is to gain insights and visualize various aspects of the retail data.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Install Jupyter Notebook by following the instructions in the official documentation: [Jupyter Installation Guide](https://jupyter.org/install).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the command `jupyter notebook` to launch Jupyter Notebook.
5. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project directory and open the `Task_3_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb` file.

## Usage

The Jupyter Notebook file `Task_3_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb` contains the code and instructions for performing exploratory data analysis on the retail dataset. It provides step-by-step guidance on loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing, exploring variables, and visualizing key insights.

To run the notebook, execute each cell sequentially. Follow the instructions and examine the generated visualizations to understand the patterns and trends in the retail data.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different visualizations or analysis techniques to explore the dataset further.
